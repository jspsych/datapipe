          <Text>
            DataPipe serves as a connection between an experiment and the Open
            Science Framework. To use DataPipe, you will need to use a webhost
            to get your experiment online (e.g., GitHub Pages) and then add some
            code to your experiment to send data to DataPipe. You will also need
            to have an OSF account to store the data and create an authorization
            token on the OSF to allow DataPipe to write data to your OSF
            account. Our{" "}

          <Text mb={2}>
            No, you will need to use a different service to make the experiment
            available online. The benefit of using this service is that you do
            not need to configure any of the backend/server components of an
            experiment, so you can use a provider like GitHub Pages to host the
            experiment for free.

        <FAQItem question="Will DataPipe store my data?">
          <Text>
            Not directly. DataPipe helps you store your data on the Open Science
            Framework. When you use DataPipe, the data is routed through our
            service to (optionally) perform validation and then we send it to
            the OSF. DataPipe does not store a copy of the data.

        <FAQItem question="Why is DataPipe free?">
          <Text>
            The expensive parts of hosting an experiment are providing storage
            and bandwidth for the experiment files and data. Fortunately there
            are providers who are willing to do both of these things for free.
            GitHub (and others) will host a website for free and the Open
            Science Framework will store data for free. Unfortunately these
            providers are not directly connected to each other, so that is what
            we are trying to solve. DataPipe is a very lightweight (i.e., cheap)
            service that makes it easy to link a hosting provider with a data
            storage provider.

            We host DataPipe using Google Firebase, so the cost of DataPipe
            depends on how much usage it gets. Currently our resource
            consumption is less than $1 per month. Once we have been up and

        <FAQItem question="Who can see the data that I collect using DataPipe?">
          <Text>
            The data that you send to DataPipe are not stored anywhere on our
            servers and we do not log any information about the data when it is
            sent. If your OSF component that receives the data is private, then
            you have full control over who can see the data. If your OSF
            component is public, then anyone can see the data.

          <Text mb={2}>
            There are a few risks that you should be aware of before using
            DataPipe.

          <OrderedList>
            <ListItem>
              In order to use this service you must provide us with an OSF
              authorization token so that we can write data to your OSF account
              on your behalf. This key enables full write access, so if we
              suffer a data breach it would be possible for someone who got
              access to the token to make malicious changes to your OSF account.
              To mitigate this risk, you should create an OSF token that is just
              for this service so that you can revoke authorization when you are
              done using the service. The strongest security would be to use an
              active token only when you need to collect data through this
              service.

            <ListItem>
              This service does allow a technically savvy user to potentially
              write fake data to your OSF project. This is almost always a risk
              with online experiments because the data are usually recorded on
              the participant&apos;s computer before being sent to the server.
              It is possible for a malicious user to change or create the data
              before sending it to the service. It is also possible that a user
              could spam data to your OSF account or could send files that are
              not actually experiment data. We provide tools to mitigate these
              risks by allowing you to specify validation rules for the data
              that is sent and to rate limit the amount of data you are
              receiving.

              This service is not a commercial venture with a dedicated user

              and thoroughly tested. The service is hosted using the Google
              Cloud, so we get the benefit of Google&apos;s infrastructure to
              make sure the service is secure and keeps running.

        <FAQItem question="How does data validation work?">
          <Text mb={2}>
            DataPipe has an optional feature that will validate any incoming
            data before sending it to the OSF. Currently, this feature supports
            checking whether an incoming file is valid JSON or CSV data (meaning
            that it has the correct format) and it allows you to specify a set
            of columns/fields that the data must contain. For CSV data, the
            validation simply checks if all of the required columns are in the
            header row. For JSON data, the validation checks if all of the
            required fields are present in at least one object in the data. For
            example, if the data are an array of trials (as jsPsych generates),
            then this validation will generate a list of all of the unique
            fields that are present in any of the trials and then check if all
            of the required fields are present. This is equivalent to converting
            the data to CSV format and then checking if all of the required
            columns are present.

          <Text>
            If an invalid data file is sent, it will be rejected and not sent to
            the OSF. There is no way to recover this data. This feature is not
            designed to catch errors in legitimate data files. It is designed to
            prevent malicious users from sending non-data files to your OSF
            project.

        <FAQItem question="How does base 64 data collection work?">
          <Text mb={2}>
            DataPipe has an optional feature that will collect data as base 64
            encoded strings. This is useful if you want to collect data that is
            not text-based, like JSON or CSV. This feature is designed to
            collect a single file of data at a time. For example, if you are
            running an experiment where the participant will record several
            audio files, you could use this feature to send each file to the OSF
            as it is recorded. When DataPipe gets a base 64 encoded file, it
            will decode it and then send it to the OSF as a file.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Note that validating base 64 encoded data is not currently
            supported, so enabling this feature does create additional risk. We
            recommend minimizing this risk by enabling the feature only when you
            are actively collecting data and disabling it when you are not.

        <FAQItem question="How does condition assignment work?">
          <Text>
            When you enable condition assignment, you can call an API endpoint
            to get the next condition for a participant. DataPipe will send you
            a number between 0 and n-1, where n is the number of conditions you
            set in your experiment. If you have an experimental design with
            multiple factors, set the number of conditions to the number of
            unique cells in your design, and then use the condition number to
            determine the appropriate level of each factor. DataPipe generates
            condition numbers sequentially, so if you have 3 conditions, the
            first participant will get condition 0, the second participant will
            get condition 1, the third participant will get condition 2, and
            then the cycle will repeat.
